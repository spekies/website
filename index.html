			<h1>About me</h1>
			<h2>Currently busy studying for the SAT so this website is a work in progress.</h2>
			<p>My name is German or online I am known as spekie or spekies.</p>
			<p>I was born in Russia, Saint Petersburg. I speak Russian natively, English and German with proficiency, and I also understand some other slavic languages.</p>
			<p>I mostly learn about computers, code, read science articles, read PhD dissertations and play piano in my free time. Usually I play composers like Schubert and Chopin on the piano and code in languages like C, Python and more.</p>
			<p>My interests are mostly in philosophy, and the theoretical theories of various sciences such as computer science.</p>
			<p>For now I mostly have experience in managing Linux systems/servers for my personal projects, and some coding in C and Python. Currently learning Rust.</p>
