			<h1>The First Post</h1>
      <p>Ah yes, I don't know why I made this. I was looking for a place to express my opinions on things, certainly not political opinions because those are rather foolish of me to talk about. Anyhow this website and this section of the website known as "Blog" will be used for posts like this where I just talk about stuff, like extremely stupid stuff or whatever other word you can put there. Or maybe sometimes really logical stuff who knows...</p>
