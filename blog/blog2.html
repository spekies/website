			<h1>Astronomy without an Identity Crisis</h1>
			<p>Why is it when someone says "astronomy" some people have to think about astrology, that foolish pseudoscientific, what do you even call it? Not even a science that is for sure. I have always been curious of what is beyond there, I am sure a lot of people have. Once you release how much there really is beyond there, and our solar system you really begin to have an identity crisis. I think that is just human nature, it feels like what do we do here in life is completely small and in no relation to the universe at all, because the universe is just gases moving around, people who study fields like Astrophysis know better than me, for obvious reasons.</p>
			<p>Reading about things like a giant evolved star is nothing new, but it really piqued my interest so I wrote about it here, and will continue I guess.</p>

			<p>The above image shows the stellar surface of an AGB star designated as R Doradus. Pretty interesting stuff the sources below explain it better, but it is really interesting just how much these stars change and eventually explode overtime because of their exhaustion in energy or gases. Then you have things like the "aliens" from other planets which could actually exist because there are so many planets spotted now that are like Earth, even bigger and larger that are in the habitable zone where the temperature is nearly perfect for life.</p>
			<p>Maybe stars as some people believe are "living things" in a way because they do eventually die, even though science clearly proves that is just a piece of gas that shines. After all we may never know things that are beyond there most of the time, because we simply do not have the time, things are constantly changing and all that is left is to enjoy life. This is how you should always conclude a lecture on Astronomy without an identity crisis.</p>
			<p>Thanks for reading this, I will be writing more random stuff in the future...</p>
